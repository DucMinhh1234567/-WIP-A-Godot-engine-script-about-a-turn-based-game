## üìù Development Note
> This is a Work In Progress (WIP) project, heavily inspired by modern turn-based games like Honkai: Star Rail. There are still numerous gaps and loose logic that need improvement (possibly due to suboptimal implementation and poor execution, maybe i should have a clear plan before actually build this :b). We hope it can evolve into a complete product in the future.
> Also this is 100% scripts and it doesn't come with any images or animation, i just imagine in my head and hope it would be cool.
